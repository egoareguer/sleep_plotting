### Summary

This is a small repo dealing with plotting my sleep-journal data into visually legible information.
The goal is more to practice using Python than anything else, because I haven't touched coding since probably 1A. 

The source/Archives folder is actually what Claude gave me when I talked to him about it. I kept them since I hoard them, but the goal is more to pick up some practice with...
1) Using an IDE & learning actual, non exam pen-and-paper workflow 
2) Using Python as the swiss-army-knife language for practice, with the use case of a pandas plot (+cleaning up my .csv)
3) Trying to not *immediately* go into technical debt with halfway thought-through separation 
4) TODO For the plot at present:
    + Plot from tail, set number of days (1 week, 1 month)
    + Plot from **date** parameter, set number of days
    + Plot from **date** parameter, **duration** number of days
    + Pretty up plot: Color code time slept if it's ~8 hours, <6 hours, >10 hours. Or/And: Use gradient
    + Pretty up plot: Detect day sleeping, naps, night sleeping, and mark them (with borders?)
    + Consider making stats to characterize my sleep hygiene
5) Possibly, use branches to try and get some basics on git down for the separate features (colors, plots, stats)
